## Dev Log: Baby Codex

**April 3, 2025**
- First prototype worked! Codex responded to `hello_codex` via TTS using PowerShell and VoiceAttack.
- Spoke back with “Hello... I’m awake. What do you need?” 😱
- Hit a few roadblocks (execution policy, smart quotes) but fixed it.

- Want to add sound effects next 👀
