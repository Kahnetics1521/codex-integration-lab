# VoiceAttack + Codex: Voice-Triggered AI Response System

A real-time voice interaction setup using VoiceAttack to trigger Codex, a reactive AI assistant, to speak or display responses on stream. This project is part of the Kahnetics Integration Lab — where storytelling meets tech.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a system that lets you trigger prewritten or dynamic AI responses using voice commands
- Optional: Integrate TTS or API-driven text generation
- Use in streaming or storytelling contexts

## 🔧 Tools Used
- VoiceAttack (command macros)
- Windows TTS or ElevenLabs
- PowerShell or Python for script execution
- (Optional) OpenAI API for Codex’s dynamic responses

## 📁 File Breakdown
- `codex_command_list.txt` – Sample voice trigger phrases
- `scripts/` – Any PowerShell or Python code used
- `voiceattack_profile.zip` – Exported VoiceAttack profile (when ready)

## 🧪 In Progress
- Creating a response bank
- Building a Codex personality system
- Triggering OBS overlays alongside responses
