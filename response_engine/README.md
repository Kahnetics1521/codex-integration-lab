## ðŸ§  Response Engine

This folder contains the core logic for Codexâ€™s voice interaction system.

- `codex_response.ps1`: Main PowerShell script that maps spoken commands to voice responses using `System.Speech`.
- `.gitkeep`: Keeps the directory structure in Git (even when empty).

Future versions may include:
- Python alternative for cross-platform compatibility
- AI-generated dynamic response scripts
